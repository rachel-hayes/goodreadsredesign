                        <h2>Goodreads</h2>
                        <p>Goodreads is a mobile application that allows book lovers to discover and read more books and keep track of books they want to read. While the app serves as a convient way to find and log books, there are many areas of improvement for user interaction and usability. </p>
                        <h3>App Analysis</h3>
                        <p>The app has four main pages:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The 'Home' page is where you can browse book recommendations and see friends' reviews.</li>
                            <li>The 'My Books' page is where you can update book progress and see the books you want to read.</li>
                            <li>The 'Discover' page is where you can see book recommendations.</li>
                            <li>The 'Search' page is where you can find a specific book by searching for the name, title, author, or genre.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The app is known to have an outdated interface and gives generic recommendations that are not personalized enough to the user.</p>
                        <p>The original design of Goodreads also shows elements of bias that can impact user experience and engagement.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Problem:</b> Goodreads heavily promotes mainstream and highly popular books on its home page and search results, making it harder for readers seeking diverse recommendations.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Improvement:</b> Introduce algorithms that prioritize diverse and personalized recommendations. This can be achieved by using user preferences, past reading habits, and interactive preference quizzes to spotlight lesser-known authors and unique genres.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Problem:</b>The interface is cluttered with ads and excessive sections, implicitly biases users toward sponsored content or specific categories of books. This can make users feel overwhelmed and disoriented.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Improvement:</b> Streamline the home page by minimizing ads and creating a clean, visually appealing layout. Personalized dashboards that adapt to individual user preferences can reduce the influence of commercial bias.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Problem:</b>Reviews and ratings from highly active users disproportionately influence the perception of books. This creates a skewed view of quality and enjoyment, potentially marginalizing books that receive fewer reviews but still resonate with specific audiences.
                                <ul>
                                <li><b>Improvement:</b>Display a variety of reviews by prioritizing diversity in user demographics and reading habits. Include filtering options for different types of reviewers (e.g., genre specialists, verified accounts).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

I created a google forms of the same interview questions for other people to fill out so that I can have as much data from different users and their points of views as possible. I posted it in my Instagram and Snapchat stories so my followers could fill it out. I also decided to have ChatGPT as one of my interviewees. I conducted the interview in the same way one would a face-to-face interview; by allowing it to answer my questions one at a time and waiting for me to ask it the other questions.</p>

A majority of the users brought up similar problems with the app. For instance, most of them said that they want an option for the “Discover” feature to promote lesser-known books instead of mainstream recommendations that it currently provides. Also, some seemed to find the navigation between sections confusing and time-consuming. They said they want a more efficient way to access key features. In addition, users thought the organizing of bookshelves to be overwhelming and frustrating and thought it would be better to have sorting options or more customization options. A few users want an easier way to share their reading progress with friends and have more interactivity. Lastly, most of the users brought up how the star rating system is limited and they would like more flexibility such as having the option to give a book a half star rating.</p>

                        <p class="results">ChatGPT was asked the same questions, and answered almost the same. It also mentioned the problem of the recommended books mostly being popular and repetitive, and finding lesser-known books requires a lot of scrolling. ChatGPT brought up the issue of the navigation bar having too many clicks to access lists, and desires a more customizable or streamline navigation with quicker tabs to improve efficiency. Something that wasn’t mentioned before was that having an interactive social reading experience, like virtual book clubs and buddy reading. It also suggests adding a reading tracker that analyzes habits and offers personalized recommendations based on reading patterns and moods.</p>

                        <p>I used the information gathered through user research and ideation to create an interactive mockup in Figma of the redesigned user flow of rating books. To accommadte impairments, I made sure that the colors and fonts I used stood out and contrast. In a different user flow, I made it so that the user can change the color theme to further meet their needs. To meet accessibility guidelines, I made the buttons large enough for the user to click it with their finger and made the font large enough to see easily.</p>

                        <p>I decided to see if structured prompts would affect review completion and user engagement because I thought it would be interesting to see if users find these structured prompts helpful for expressing opinions or if they prefer the freedom of open-ended responses. I added a new element that allows users to answer specific prompts as compared to an open-ended review box to see if that would affect user experience and engagement.</p>

                        <p>I had 5 users interact with one flow (10 users total) and asked them follow-up questions about their experience. <br> Overall, screen B performed better than screen A. A majority of the users preferred having prompts to give them some starting points on writing a review.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Screen A Results
                                <ul>
                                    <li>40% of users were satisfied with the experience of the open-ended aspect of this flow.</li>
                                    <li>60% of users mentioned how it would be better if they were told how to write a review or given some starting points.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Screen B Results
                                <ul>
                                    <li>80% of users were satisfied with the suggested prompts of this flow because they felt it would help give them ideas on how to write a review. </li>
                                    <li>One thing that surprised me was how a few users mentioned how having this as an option would be perfect, but they still would want the option to write their own review as well.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I used these findings to update my prototype to be the final design that was presented previously. I originally had Screen A in my mockup, but based on the findings from this test, I combined the two so that users have the option to write their own free-response or have guided prompts. I think this final design ensures that users have even more choices when it comes to reviewing books.</p>

                        <p>I used ChatGPT to help me perform user research for this project. I think it mostly had a positive impact regarding my experience for this project because it gave me ideas and inspiration if I was stuck on anything. For instance, it gave me good interview and follow-up questions, which helped me form my questions around that. Also, ChatGPT helped keep me on the right track to ensure that I found all of the pain points in my interview responses. I inserted my responses in ChatGPT and it summarized the results, making me work more efficiently and helped me make sure that I didn't miss any important trends in data. I did notice that it gave me some biased results, but I just ignored them or I tried to write my prompt in a different way to see if it would give me a different answer.</p>
